Notifications
=============

The Notifications service supports the publish-subscribe model for delivering information to intereseted parties.
Currently only a Tapis service may directly create subscriptions and post events through this service. Users may
subscribe to job related events by creating subscriptions through the Jobs service. 
For more information on creating subscriptions through the Jobs service please see JobsSubscriptions_

.. _JobsSubscriptions: https://tapis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/technical/jobs.html#subscriptions

--------
Overview
--------
In Tapis, a notification *event* represents an occurrence that may be of interest to other parties. The
events are delivered asynchronously using a publish-subscribe model. Once an interested party has created a
*subscription*, matching *events* are delivered to the interested party as part of a *notification* object.
Deliveries are made via webhook or email. 

Currently only services may directly create subscriptions and post events.

The model for a notification event is based on the CloudEvent specification version 1.0.
For more information about CloudEvents and the specification, please see https://cloudevents.io and
https://github.com/cloudevents/spec.


Please note that although currently the Notifications service is only accessed by users through the Jobs
service, this document discusses the general design and details of the service in order to provide
information for future planned development.

-----------
Event Model
-----------
An event contains the following information:

*source*
  Context in which the event happened. For example, for a job related event originating from Tapis at the
  primary TACC site, the source would be https://tapis.io/v3/jobs.
*type*
  Type of event. Used for routing notifications. A series of 3 fields separated by the dot character.
  The first field is the service name, the second field is the category and the third field is the detail.
  For example, when a job transistions to the FINISHED state the type is ``jobs.JOB_NEW_STATUS.FINISHED``.
*subject*
  Subject of event in context of service. Examples: job Id, system Id, file path, role name, etc.
*seriesId*
  Optional Id that groups events from the same source in a series, thereby preserving event order during
  notification delivery.
*timestamp*
  When the event happened.
*data*
  Optional additional information associated with the event. For example, data specific to the service associated
  with the event.

Note that events are not persisted by the front end api service process. When events are received they are sent
to a message broker for asynchronous processing. The back end process will persist events temporarily in order
to support recovery.

Event Type
~~~~~~~~~~

An event type represents a channel through which users and services receive events. Services and users create
subscriptions with an event type filter in order to select the events delivered to them. The identifier for each
event type must have three parts in the format **<service>.<category>.<detail>**.
For example *jobs.JOB_NEW_STATUS.PENDING*, *apps.APP.UPDATE* or *files.OBJECT.DELETE*.

------------
Subscription
------------
A service can create a subscription for an event type in order to allow users and services to receive events.
Two delivery methods are supported, WEBHOOK and EMAIL.

At a high level, a subscription contains the following information:

*name*
  Optional short descriptive name. *owner+name* must be unique. Composed of alphanumeric characters and the following
  special characters: ``-._~``. If not provided, the service will create one.
*owner*
  A specific user set at create time. Default is *${apiUserId}*.
*description*
  An optional more verbose description.
*typeFilter*
  Filter to use when matching events. Matches against event type. Has three parts for matching
  *<service>.<category>.<detail>*. Each field may be a specific type or the wildcard character ``*``.
*subjectFilter*
  Filter to use when matching events. Matches against event subject. This may be a specific subject such as a job Id
  or the wildcard character, ``*``.
*deliveryTargets*
  List of targets to be used when delivering an event. Each target includes delivery method (EMAIL or WEBHOOK) and
  delivery address.
*ttlMinutes*
  Time to live in minutes. Specified when subscription created. Default is one week from creation.
  A TTL of 0 or less indicates no expiration. May be updated through an API call. Attribute *expiry* is recomputed when
  this attribute is updated.
*expiry*
  Time at which the subscription expires. Maintained by the service. Computed at create time and recomputed when attribute
  *ttlMinutes* is updated.

The attributes *typeFilter*, *subjectFilter* and *deliveryTargets* are required.

Subscription Name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For each owner the name must be unique and can be composed of alphanumeric characters and the following special
characters: ``-._~``. If the attribute *name* is not provided, then the service will generate one using the template::

 <jwtUser>~<owner>~<oboTenant>~<subjectFilter>~<random4>

For example::

 jobs~testuser1~dev~jobs.JOB_NEW_STATUS.ALL~m4Kx

Note that when constructing the name:

* *subjectFilter* will be truncated to 40 characters
* If *subjectFilter* is the wildcard character ``*``, it is replaced with the string ``ALL`` when constructing the name.
* The last 4 characters are generated at random from the set of alphanumeric characters including upper case, lower case and digits.


Delivery Target
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each subscription will contain a list of delivery targets for use in delivering events.
The list must contain at least one item. WEBHOOK and EMAIL deliveries are supported.

A delivery target contains the following information:

* *deliveryMethod* - The type of delivery method: WEBHOOK, EMAIL
* *deliveryAddress* - URL for WEBHOOK or email address for EMAIL


------------------
Notification Model
------------------
A notification is an object encapsulating the information sent to a delivery target. It contains the following:

* *uuid* - Unique identifier for the notification.
* *event* - All information contained in the event. See above under the section `Event Model`_.
* *eventUuid* - Unique identifier for the event.
* *tenant* - tenant associated with the notification.
* *subscriptionName* - Name of subscription associated with the notification.
* *deliveryTarget* - the delivery target
* *created* Timestamp for when the notification was created.

Example of a notification sent to a webhook::

 {
   "uuid": "30d70395-d5e9-43a4-ae90-2306b6bb00d6",
   "tenant": "admin",

---------------------
Notification Delivery
---------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

When events are published to the Notifications front end api service, they are initially placed on a message
broker queue to be picked up asynchronously by a back end worker process known as the dispatch service.
Currently RabbitMQ is used as the message broker. 

The dispatch service reads events from the queue and assigns them to workers known as *delivery bucket managers*.
Delivery bucket managers are threads that receive their assigned events from in-memory queues.
The dispatch service assigns events to a bucket manager by taking a hash of the event *source*,
*subject* and *seriesId*.

When a bucket manager worker receives an event to process, it first finds all matching subscriptions by
querying a database. As discussed above, the matching is based on the *typeFilter* and *subjectFilter*
defined in a subscription.

For each delivery target in each matching subscription, the worker creates a Notification object and persists it
to a database. By persisting to a database we are able to support recovery and retries. The worker then begins
the process of delivering the notifications.


Configuring for EMAIL Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Supporting delivery by EMAIL involves configuring the Tapis Notifications service to use an SMTP relay.
This must be done by the Tapis systems administrator. Parameters for the relay are set as environment variables
to be picked up by the dispatcher service when it is started during a deployment.
For more information on deployer configuration please see `Notifications_Email_Config`_.

.. _Notifications_Email_Config: https://tapis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/deployer.html#configuring-support-for-email-notifications


Please note that deployer currently only supports template variables for TAPIS_MAIL_PROVIDER, TAPIS_SMTP_HOST and TAPIS_SMTP_PORT.
Other environment variables must be set manually in the deployment. 

The environment variables used to configure email delivery are:

*TAPIS_MAIL_PROVIDER*
  Optional. Supported values: SMTP, LOG, NONE. Default is LOG.
  This should typically be set to SMTP. Setting to LOG results in the dispatcher generating a log message showing
  the email information. Setting to NONE results in delivery being a NO-OP.
*TAPIS_SMTP_HOST*
  Required if provider is SMTP. Host to use as relay when sending email via SMTP.
*TAPIS_SMTP_PORT*
  Optional. Port used when sending email using SMTP. Default is 25.
*TAPIS_SMTP_FROM_NAME*
  Optional. Name for the email `From:` field. Default value is *Tapis Notifications Service*.
*TAPIS_SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS*
  Optional. Address for the email `From:` field. Default value is *no-reply@nowhere.com*.
*TAPIS_SMTP_AUTH*
  Optional. Boolean indicating if SMTP server requires a username and password. Default is *false*.
*TAPIS_SMTP_USER*
  Required if TAPIS_SMTP_AUTH is *true*.
*TAPIS_SMTP_PASSWORD*
  Required if TAPIS_SMTP_AUTH is *true*.

EMAIL Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the notification delivery method is of type EMAIL, the dispatch worker will send an email using SMTP.

The ``To:`` field for the email will be the notification delivery address.

The ``From:`` field for the email will depend on the configuration parameters, as discussed above in the
section `Configuring for EMAIL Delivery`_. By default this will be::

  Tapis Notifications Service <no-reply@nowhere.com>

The ``Subject:`` of the email will have the following format::

  Tapis v3 notification. Event type: <event_type> subject: <subject>

If the event has no *subject* then the email subject will not have the subject portion.

An example email subject for the case where the event contains a *subject* attribute::

  Tapis v3 notification. Event type: jobs.JOB_NEW_STATUS.FINISHED subject: 1451b0ef-c057-4177-acd5-51a4901acb07-007

The body of the email will contain the notification data as json. An example may be found above under the section
`Notification Model`_. 

WEBHOOK Delivery
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the notification delivery method is of type WEBHOOK, the dispatch worker will deliver the notification using an
HTTP POST request. The media type for the request will be *application/json* and the following header will be
added: ``User-Agent: Tapis/v3``.

The request body will be a json structure with the notification information.
An example may be found above under the section `Notification Model`_.
